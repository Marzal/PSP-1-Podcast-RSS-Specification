# Namespace declarations
Podcast feeds utilize RSS 2.0 tags and require extensions from three namespaces (itunes, podcast, and atom). These namespace declarations must be made in the opening of your XML.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rss version="2.0" xmlns:itunes="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd" xmlns:podcast="https://podcastindex.org/namespace/1.0" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
```

## HTML and Link Support (optional)
To include HTML in your podcast feed, you must also declare the RDF Site Summary 1.0 Content Module Specification namespace in the second line of your XML.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rss version="2.0" xmlns:itunes="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd" xmlns:podcast="https://podcastindex.org/namespace/1.0" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/">
```

With the RDF Site Summary 1.0 Content Module Specification namespace included, you can enclose all portions of your XML that contain embedded HTML in a CDATA section to prevent formatting issues and to ensure proper link functionality.

```xml
<![CDATA[
  <a href="https://www.podstandards.org">The Podcast Standards Project</a>
]]>
````

Namespace definitions are case-sensitive and must be entered as shown.

Feeds must be plain text UTF-8 encoded. Node values are limited to 255 characters unless otherwise specified and should have no leading or trailing spaces.

# RSS Feed Elements
All elements within a podcast RSS feed will have `<channel>` or `<item>` parent tags. Elements at the `<channel>` level describe the podcast, while elements at the `<item>` level describe an episode.

Required elements must be present in your RSS feed to pass validation. Recommended elements are encouraged because they provide useful information to listeners. Situational elements may be important for specific podcasts, podcasters, or listeners.

__Note:__ This document describes the standard elements for podcast RSS feeds. The extendable nature of RSS allows for the use of additional elements as long as a proper namespace extension is declared in the XML. The itunes, podcast, and atom namespace extensions include additional "non-standard" elements that can be used in podcast RSS feeds, although broad support should not be expected.

## Required `<channel>`

### [`<atom:link rel="self">`](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.7)
The declared canonical feed URL for the podcast.

````xml
<atom:link href="https://www.podstandards.org/my-podcast.rss" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml" />
````

## [`<title>`](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-2-0#requiredChannelElements)
The podcast title. A string containing the name of a podcast and nothing else.

````xml
<title>Sample Podcast Title</title>
````
