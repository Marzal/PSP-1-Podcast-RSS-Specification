# Namespace Declarations
Podcast feeds utilize RSS 2.0 tags and require extensions from three namespaces (itunes, podcast, and atom). These namespace declarations must be made in the opening of your XML.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rss version="2.0" xmlns:itunes="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd" xmlns:podcast="https://podcastindex.org/namespace/1.0" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom">
```

## HTML and Link Support (optional)
To include HTML in your podcast feed, you must also declare the RDF Site Summary 1.0 Content Module Specification namespace in the second line of your XML.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<rss version="2.0" xmlns:itunes="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd" xmlns:podcast="https://podcastindex.org/namespace/1.0" xmlns:atom="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/">
```

With the RDF Site Summary 1.0 Content Module Specification namespace included, you can enclose all portions of your XML that contain embedded HTML in a CDATA section to prevent formatting issues and to ensure proper link functionality.

```xml
<![CDATA[
  <a href="https://www.podstandards.org">The Podcast Standards Project</a>
]]>
````

Namespace definitions are case-sensitive and must be entered as shown.

Feeds must be plain text UTF-8 encoded. Node values are limited to 255 characters unless otherwise specified and should have no leading or trailing spaces.

# RSS Feed Elements
All elements within a podcast RSS feed will have `<channel>` or `<item>` parent tags. Elements at the `<channel>` level describe the podcast, while elements at the `<item>` level describe an episode.

Required elements must be present in your RSS feed to pass validation. Recommended elements are encouraged because they provide useful information to listeners. Situational elements may be important for specific podcasts, podcasters, or listeners.

__Note:__ This document describes the standard elements for podcast RSS feeds. The extendable nature of RSS allows for the use of additional elements as long as a proper namespace extension is declared in the XML. The itunes, podcast, and atom namespace extensions include additional "non-standard" elements that can be used in podcast RSS feeds, although broad support should not be expected.

## Required `<channel>`

### `<atom:link rel="self">`
The declared canonical feed URL for the podcast. [Official Docs](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.7)

````xml
<atom:link href="https://www.podstandards.org/my-podcast.rss" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml" />
````
<br><br>
### `<title>`
The podcast title. A string containing the name of a podcast and nothing else. [Official Docs](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-2-0#requiredChannelElements)

````xml
<title>Sample Podcast Title</title>
````

_Including keywords in an attempt to improve a podcast's search ranking, may result in being blocked from certain directories._
<br><br>
### `<description>`
Text that describes a podcast to potential listeners. [Official Docs](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-2-0#requiredChannelElements)

````xml
<description>Sample podcast description.</description>
````

````xml
<description><![CDATA[Sample podcast description.]]></description>
````

The maximum amount of text allowed for this tag is 4,000 bytes.
<br><br>
### `<link>`
The website or web page associated with a podcast. [Official Docs](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-2-0#requiredChannelElements)

````xml
<link>https://www.podstandards.org</link>
````

````xml
<link>https://www.podstandards.org/podcast</link>
````
<br><br>
### `<language>`
The language that is spoken on the podcast, specified in the [ISO 639](http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php) format. [Official Docs](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-2-0#requiredChannelElements)

````xml
<language>en-us</language>
````
<br><br>
### `<itunes:category>`
The category that best fits a podcast, selected from the list of [Apple Podcasts categories](https://podcasters.apple.com/support/1691-apple-podcasts-categories). [Official Docs](https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itcb54353390)

````xml
<itunes:category text="News">
  <itunes:category text="Tech News" />
</itunes:category>
<itunes:category text="Technology" />
````

Multiple category selections are permitted. Categories should be listed in order of priority.
<br><br>
### `<itunes:explicit>`
The parental advisory information for a podcast. [Official Docs](https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itcb54353390)

````xml
<itunes:explicit>false</itunes:explicit>
````

The value can be __true__, indicating the presence of explicit content, or __false__, indicating that a podcast doesn’t contain explicit language or adult content.
<br><br>
### `<itunes:image>`
The artwork for the podcast, specified by providing a URL linking to it. [Official Docs](https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itcb54353390)

````xml
<itunes:image href="https://www.podstandards.org/podcast/artwork.jpg" />
````

Verify the web server hosting your image allows HTTP head requests.

Image must be a minimum size of 1400 x 1400 pixels and a maximum size of 3000 x 3000 pixels, in JPEG or PNG format, 72 dpi, with appropriate file extensions (.jpg, .png), and in the RGB colorspace. File type extension must match the actual file type of the image file.
<br><br>
## Recommended `<channel>`

### `<podcast:locked>`
Tells podcast hosting platforms whether they are allowed to import this feed. [Official Docs](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/docs/1.0.md#locked)

````xml
<podcast:locked>yes</podcast:locked>
````

A value of __yes__ means that import attempts should be rejected. A value of __no__ means the feed can be imported.
<br><br>
### `<podcast:guid>`
The globally unique identifier ([GUID](https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html#ltguidgtSubelementOfLtitemgt)) for a podcast. The value is a UUIDv5, and generated from the RSS feed URL, with the protocol scheme and trailing slashes stripped off, combined with a unique "podcast" namespace which has a UUID of ead4c236-bf58-58c6-a2c6-a6b28d128cb6. [Official Docs](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/docs/1.0.md#guid)

Example GUID for feed url podnews.net/rss:

````xml
<podcast:guid>9b024349-ccf0-5f69-a609-6b82873eab3c</podcast:guid>
````

A podcast gets assigned a podcast:guid once in its lifetime using its current feed url (at the time of assignment) as the seed value. That GUID is then meant to follow the podcast from then on, for the duration of its life, even if the feed url changes. This means that when a podcast moves from one hosting platform to another, its podcast:guid should be discovered by the new host and imported into the new platform for inclusion into the feed.

Using this pattern, podcasts can maintain a consistent identity across the open RSS ecosystem without a central authority.
<br><br>
### `<itunes:author>`
The group, person, or people responsible for creating the podcast. [Official Docs](https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itcb54353390)

````xml
<itunes:author>Dallas Times-Herald</itunes:author>
````
<br><br>
## Situational `<channel>`

### `<copyright>`
The copyright details for a podcast. [Official Docs](https://www.rssboard.org/rss-2-0#optionalChannelElements)

````xml
<copyright>The Podcast Standards Project</copyright>
````

Should not include the word "Copyright", the © symbol, and/or a year.
<br><br>
### `<podcast:txt>`
A free-form text field to present a string in a podcast feed. [Official Docs](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/docs/1.0.md#txt)

````xml
<podcast:txt>naj3eEZaWVVY9a38uhX8FekACyhtqP4JN</podcast:txt>
````

````xml
<podcast:txt purpose="verify">S6lpp-7ZCn8-dZfGc-OoyaG</podcast:txt>
````

The node value is limited to 4,000 characters. This element can optionally be used with a purpose attribute (128 characters). The free-form nature requires that this attribute is also free-formed.
<br><br>
### `<podcast:funding>`
Lists donation/funding links for the podcast. The content of the tag is the recommended string to be used with the link. [Official Docs](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/docs/1.0.md#funding)

````xml
<podcast:funding url="https://www.podstandards.org/support">Support</podcast:funding>
````
<br><br>
### `<itunes:type>`
Specifies the podcast as either __episodic__ or __serial__. [Official Docs](https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itcb54353390)

````xml
<itunes:type>episodic</itunes:type>
````

````xml
<itunes:type>serial</itunes:type>
````

Episodic is the default and assumed if this element is not present. This element is required for serial podcasts.
<br><br>
### `<itunes:complete>`
Specifies that a podcast is complete and will not post any more episodes in the future. [Official Docs](https://help.apple.com/itc/podcasts_connect/#/itcb54353390)

````xml
<itunes:complete>yes</itunes:complete>
````

The only valid value for this element is __yes__. All other values will be ignored.
